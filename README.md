poker_bot is a learning project I assigned myself after reading mid-way
through reading Eric Matthes 'Python Crash Course'

This is the first application I have ever tried to develop, and it's
bound to be refactored into multiple uses. It's current function is to
service as a learning tool, and the current goal is to get poker_bot
as feature rich as possible.
