poker_bot is a learning project I assigned myself after reading mid-way
through reading Eric Matthes 'Python Crash Course'. All knowledge I have
of python up to this point is from the aforementioned book and from
the python documentation at python.org.

This is the first application I have ever tried to develop, and it's
bound to be refactored into multiple uses. It's current function is to
serve as a learning tool for myself, and the current goal is to get poker_bot
as feature rich as possible.

Keep an eye out for future projects. I have a _ton_ of ideas.
